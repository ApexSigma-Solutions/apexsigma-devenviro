## Risk Analysis

### High Risks
1. **Competition**: GitHub, Microsoft, Google entering space
2. **Technical**: Scaling Gemma 3 to millions of users
3. **Market**: Developer adoption slower than projected
4. **Legal**: IP issues with AI-generated code

### Medium Risks
1. **Security**: Data breaches or privacy issues
2. **Performance**: Latency at scale
3. **Compliance**: Regulatory changes
4. **Team**: Hiring and retaining talent

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Strong IP protection and patents**
- **Diversified technical architecture**
- **Conservative financial planning**
- **Security-first development approach**
- **Experienced advisory board**

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- **Extension adoption**: Downloads, active users
- **Performance**: < 200ms response times
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability
- **User satisfaction**: 4.5+ stars, low churn

### Business KPIs
- **Revenue growth**: 100%+ YoY
- **User growth**: 50%+ monthly active user growth
- **Market share**: Top 3 in AI developer tools
- **Customer satisfaction**: Net Promoter Score > 50

This expansion would create a **$100M+ opportunity** but requires significant investment, team scaling, and execution excellence. The market timing is perfect with the AI developer tools boom, but the competition will be fierce.
