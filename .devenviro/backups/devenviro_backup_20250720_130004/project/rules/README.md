# ApexSigma DevEnviro Rules System

## Overview

The Rules System provides hierarchical configuration and enforcement for code quality, security, and organizational standards across the ApexSigma DevEnviro ecosystem.

## Hierarchy Structure

```
rules/
├── global/           # Organization-wide rules (ApexSigma Solutions)
├── project/          # Project-specific rules (DevEnviro)
├── local/           # Workspace/developer-specific overrides
└── system/          # Core system rules and templates
```

## Rule Categories

### Code Quality Rules
- **Formatting**: Black, isort, line length, indentation
- **Linting**: flake8, mypy, pylint configurations
- **Testing**: Coverage requirements, naming conventions
- **Documentation**: Docstring standards, README requirements

### Security Rules
- **Secrets**: Detection and prevention of committed secrets
- **Permissions**: File access and execution rules
- **Dependencies**: Allowed packages and versions
- **API Access**: Authentication and authorization standards

### Process Rules
- **Commit Messages**: Format and content requirements
- **Pull Requests**: Review requirements, templates
- **Branching**: Naming conventions, merge strategies
- **Deployment**: Release and rollback procedures

### Business Rules
- **Naming Conventions**: File, function, variable standards
- **Architecture**: Patterns and anti-patterns
- **Performance**: Benchmarks and optimization guidelines
- **Compliance**: Industry and regulatory requirements

## Rule Inheritance

Rules follow a hierarchical inheritance pattern:

1. **System Rules** (lowest priority) - Core defaults
2. **Global Rules** - Organization-wide standards
3. **Project Rules** - Project-specific requirements
4. **Local Rules** (highest priority) - Developer overrides

Later rules override earlier ones where conflicts exist.

## Rule Enforcement

### Automatic Enforcement
- **Pre-commit hooks** validate rules before commit
- **CI/CD pipelines** enforce rules during build/deploy
- **DevEnviro startup** validates workspace compliance
- **Real-time validation** during development

### Manual Enforcement
- **Rule audits** via `devenviro audit-rules`
- **Compliance reports** via `devenviro rules-report`
- **Rule validation** via `devenviro validate-rules`

## Usage

### Loading Rules
```bash
# Load and validate all applicable rules
devenviro load-rules

# Load specific rule category
devenviro load-rules --category security

# Load for specific context
devenviro load-rules --context project
```

### Validating Compliance
```bash
# Check current workspace against all rules
devenviro audit-rules

# Check specific files
devenviro audit-rules --files src/module.py

# Generate compliance report
devenviro rules-report --format json
```

### Managing Rules
```bash
# List active rules
devenviro list-rules

# Show rule details
devenviro show-rule unicode-policy

# Test rule changes
devenviro test-rules --dry-run
```

## Rule Definition Format

Rules are defined in YAML format with the following structure:

```yaml
meta:
  name: "unicode-policy"
  version: "1.0.0"
  category: "code-quality"
  level: "global"
  description: "Enforce Unicode compatibility for Windows terminals"

rules:
  - id: "no-unicode-in-print"
    severity: "error"
    message: "Unicode characters not allowed in print statements"
    pattern: 'print.*[^\x00-\x7F]'
    files: "**/*.py"
    
enforcement:
  pre_commit: true
  ci_cd: true
  real_time: false
  
exceptions:
  - "docs/**/*.py"  # Documentation can use Unicode
  - "tests/test_unicode.py"  # Test files for Unicode handling
```

## Integration Points

### DevEnviro Startup Context
Rules are automatically loaded during DevEnviro initialization and included in startup context for intelligent assistance.

### Claude/Gemini CLI Integration
Rules context is available to AI assistants for:
- Code review suggestions
- Compliance validation
- Best practice recommendations
- Error prevention

### VS Code Integration
Rules are integrated with VS Code via:
- Settings and workspace configuration
- Extension recommendations
- Task definitions
- Problem matcher integration

## Rule Development

### Creating New Rules
1. Define rule in appropriate hierarchy level
2. Test with `devenviro test-rules`
3. Validate with `devenviro validate-rules`
4. Deploy with `devenviro deploy-rules`

### Rule Templates
Use system templates for common rule patterns:
- `devenviro create-rule --template security`
- `devenviro create-rule --template formatting`
- `devenviro create-rule --template documentation`

## Governance

### Rule Approval Process
1. **Proposal** - Create rule definition and rationale
2. **Review** - Team review and feedback
3. **Testing** - Validate impact on existing code
4. **Approval** - Formal approval and documentation
5. **Deployment** - Gradual rollout and monitoring

### Change Management
- **Versioning** - Semantic versioning for rule changes
- **Deprecation** - Graceful migration for breaking changes
- **Impact Assessment** - Analysis of proposed changes
- **Rollback** - Emergency rollback procedures

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Compliance Metrics
- Rule violation rates by category
- Compliance trends over time
- Developer adherence scores
- Automated fix success rates

### Rule Effectiveness
- Rule activation/deactivation rates
- Exception request patterns
- Developer feedback and satisfaction
- Code quality improvement metrics
