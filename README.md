# ApexSigma DevEnviro Project

Building a cognitive collaboration system on Windows with WSL2.

## Environment
- OS: Windows with WSL2 Debian
- Python 3.9+ with modern tooling
- Docker services for memory and vector storage

## Current Status
- ✅ Basic project structure with packaging
- ✅ Memory service (simple SQLite-based) running on port 8000
- ✅ Qdrant vector database running on port 6333
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- ✅ Security scanning and code quality tools
- ✅ OpenRouter API integration support
- ⚠️ Docker health check needs fixing (service works fine)

## Services
- **Memory Service**: http://localhost:8000 (24 memories, 6 users)
- **Qdrant Vector DB**: http://localhost:6333 
- **Simple Memory API**: Basic text storage and search

## Next Steps
- Set OPENROUTER_API_KEY for AI-powered memory operations
- Fix Docker health check configuration
- Expand cognitive functionality without autonomous assumptions
